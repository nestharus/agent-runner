# Resize Observer

**Full documentation:** https://webawesome.com/docs/components/resize-observer


`<wa-resize-observer>` Since 2.0 stable

The Resize Observer component offers a thin, declarative interface to the [`ResizeObserver API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver).

The resize observer will report changes to the dimensions of the elements it wraps through the `wa-resize` event. When emitted, a collection of [`ResizeObserverEntry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserverEntry) objects will be attached to `event.detail` that contains the target element and information about its dimensions.

```html
<div class="resize-observer-overview">
  <wa-resize-observer>
    <div>Resize this box and watch the console 👉</div>
  </wa-resize-observer>
</div>

<script>
  const container = document.querySelector('.resize-observer-overview');
  const resizeObserver = container.querySelector('wa-resize-observer');

  resizeObserver.addEventListener('wa-resize', event => {
    console.log(event.detail);
  });
</script>

<style>
  .resize-observer-overview div {
    display: flex;
    border: solid 2px var(--wa-color-surface-border);
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 4rem 2rem;
  }
</style>
```
