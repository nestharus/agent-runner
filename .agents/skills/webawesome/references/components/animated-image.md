# Animated Image

**Full documentation:** https://webawesome.com/docs/components/animated-image


`<wa-animated-image>` Since 2.0 stable

A component for displaying animated GIFs and WEBPs that play and pause on interaction.

```html
<wa-animated-image
  src="https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif"
  alt="Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement"
></wa-animated-image>
```

This component uses `<canvas>` to draw freeze frames, so images are subject to [cross-origin restrictions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image).

## Examples

### WEBP Images

Both GIF and WEBP images are supported.

```html
<wa-animated-image
  src="https://shoelace.style/assets/images/tie.webp"
  alt="Animation of a shoe being tied"
></wa-animated-image>
```

### Setting a Width and Height

To set a custom size, apply a width and/or height to the host element.

```html
<wa-animated-image
  src="https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif"
  alt="Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement"
  style="width: 150px; height: 200px;"
>
</wa-animated-image>
```

### Customizing the Control Box

You can change the appearance and location of the control box by targeting the `control-box` part in your styles.

```html
<wa-animated-image
  src="https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif"
  alt="Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement"
  class="animated-image-custom-control-box"
></wa-animated-image>

<style>
  .animated-image-custom-control-box::part(control-box) {
    top: auto;
    right: auto;
    bottom: 1rem;
    left: 1rem;
    background-color: deeppink;
    border: none;
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
```
