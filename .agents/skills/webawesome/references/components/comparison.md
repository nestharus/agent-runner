# Comparison

**Full documentation:** https://webawesome.com/docs/components/comparison


`<wa-comparison>` Since 2.0 stable

Compare visual differences between similar content with a sliding panel.

This is especially useful for comparing images, but can be used for comparing any type of content (for an example of using it to compare entire UIs, check out our [theme page](https://webawesome.com/docs/themes)). For best results, use content that shares the same dimensions. The slider can be controlled by dragging or pressing the left and right arrow keys. (Tip: press shift + arrows to move the slider in larger intervals, or home + end to jump to the beginning or end.)

## Examples

### Initial Position

Use the `position` attribute to set the initial position of the slider. This is a percentage from `0` to `100`.

```html
<wa-comparison position="25">

    alt="A person sitting on bricks wearing untied boots."
