# Popover

**Full documentation:** https://webawesome.com/docs/components/popover


`<wa-popover>` Since 3.0 stable

Popovers display contextual content and interactive elements in a floating panel.

Popovers display interactive content when their anchor element is clicked. Unlike [tooltips](https://webawesome.com/docs/components/tooltip), popovers can contain links, buttons, and form controls. They appear without an overlay and will close when you click outside or press Escape. Only one popover can be open at a time.

```html
<wa-popover for="popover__overview">
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem;">
    <p>This popover contains interactive content that users can engage with directly.</p>
    <wa-button variant="primary" size="small">Take Action</wa-button>
  </div>
</wa-popover>

<wa-button id="popover__overview">Show popover</wa-button>
```

## Examples

### Assigning an Anchor

Use `<wa-button>` or `<button>` elements as popover anchors. Connect the popover to its anchor by setting the `for` attribute to match the anchor's `id`.

```html
<wa-button id="popover__anchor-button">Show Popover</wa-button>

<wa-popover for="popover__anchor-button"> I'm anchored to a Web Awesome button. </wa-popover>

<br /><br />

<button id="popover__anchor-native-button">Show Popover</button>

<wa-popover for="popover__anchor-native-button"> I'm anchored to a native button. </wa-popover>
```

Make sure the anchor element exists in the DOM before the popover connects. If it doesn't exist, the popover won't attach and you'll see a console warning.

### Opening and Closing

Popovers show when you click their anchor element. You can also control them programmatically by setting the `open` property to `true` or `false`.

Use `data-popover="close"` on any button inside a popover to close it automatically.

```html
<wa-popover for="popover__opening">
  <p>The button below has <code>data-popover="close"</code> so clicking it will close the popover.</p>
  <wa-button data-popover="close" variant="primary">Dismiss</wa-button>
</wa-popover>

<wa-button id="popover__opening">Show popover</wa-button>
```

### Placement

Use the `placement` attribute to set where the popover appears relative to its anchor. The popover will automatically reposition if there isn't enough space in the preferred location. The default placement is `top`.

```html
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; align-items: center;">
  <wa-button id="popover__top">Top</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__top" placement="top">I'm on the top</wa-popover>

  <wa-button id="popover__bottom">Bottom</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__bottom" placement="bottom">I'm on the bottom</wa-popover>

  <wa-button id="popover__left">Left</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__left" placement="left">I'm on the left</wa-popover>

  <wa-button id="popover__right">Right</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__right" placement="right">I'm on the right</wa-popover>
</div>
```

### Distance

Use the `distance` attribute to control how far the popover appears from its anchor.

```html
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; align-items: center;">
  <wa-button id="popover__distance-near">Near</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__distance-near" distance="0">I'm very close</wa-popover>

  <wa-button id="popover__distance-far">Far</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__distance-far" distance="30">I'm farther away</wa-popover>
</div>
```

### Arrow Size

Use the `--arrow-size` custom property to change the size of the popover's arrow. To remove it, use the `without-arrow` attribute.

```html
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; align-items: center;">
  <wa-button id="popover__big-arrow">Big arrow</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__big-arrow" style="--arrow-size: 8px;">I have a big arrow</wa-popover>

  <wa-button id="popover__no-arrow">No arrow</wa-button>
  <wa-popover for="popover__no-arrow" without-arrow>I don't have an arrow</wa-popover>
</div>
```

### Setting a Maximum Width

Use the `--max-width` custom property to control the maximum width of the popover.

```html
<wa-button id="popover__max-width">Toggle me</wa-button>
<wa-popover for="popover__max-width" style="--max-width: 160px;">
  Popovers will usually grow to be much wider, but this one has a custom max width that forces text to wrap.
</wa-popover>
```

### Setting Focus

Use the [`autofocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) global attribute to move focus to a specific form control when the popover opens.

```html
<wa-popover for="popover__autofocus">
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem;">
    <wa-textarea autofocus placeholder="What's on your mind?" size="small" resize="none" rows="3"></wa-textarea>
    <wa-button variant="primary" size="small" data-popover="close"> Submit </wa-button>
  </div>
</wa-popover>

<wa-button id="popover__autofocus">
  <wa-icon name="comment" slot="start"></wa-icon>
  Feedback
</wa-button>
```
