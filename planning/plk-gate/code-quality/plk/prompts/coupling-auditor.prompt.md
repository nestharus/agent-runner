# Coupling Auditor Prompt

Run the coupling auditor for the PLK Phase-6 code-quality gate.

Inputs:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| mode | phase-6 |
| worktree_path | `/home/nes/projects/agent-runner/worktrees/age-pid-sidecar` |
| diff_path | `/home/nes/projects/agent-runner/worktrees/age-pid-sidecar/planning/plk-gate/gates/diff.patch` |
| touched_surfaces_path | `/home/nes/projects/agent-runner/worktrees/age-pid-sidecar/planning/plk-gate/gates/touched-files.txt` |
| proposal_path | `/home/nes/projects/agent-runner/worktrees/age-pid-sidecar/planning/plk-gate/proposal.md` |
| contract_path | `/home/nes/projects/agent-runner/worktrees/age-pid-sidecar/planning/plk-gate/contracts/plk.contract.md` |
| runtime_artifact_evidence_path | `/home/nes/projects/agent-runner/worktrees/age-pid-sidecar/planning/plk-gate/evidence/runtime-tests.log` |
| output_path | `/home/nes/projects/agent-runner/worktrees/age-pid-sidecar/planning/plk-gate/code-quality/plk/reports/coupling-auditor.md` |

Read `/home/nes/ai/conventions/code-quality.md` before scoring. Audit imports, module boundaries, sidecar access, StateDb access, and parent-env coupling in the touched PLK surfaces. Do not modify the worktree except to write the report to `output_path`.

End the report with exactly one terminal line: `VERDICT: LOW`, `VERDICT: MEDIUM`, or `VERDICT: HIGH`.
